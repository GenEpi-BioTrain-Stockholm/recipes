## Background

This is a typical spanish dish, but you may find great variation across regions, cities, towns and even families. This is fairly representative from the Castilla and Leon area, but do not take it as representative from anywhere else.

## Ingredients (for 6 people)

* 1kg of **chickpeas**
* 500 gr of **beef** called "morcillo" in spanish
* One (or two if you wish) **morcilla** (fried pig blood)
* At least 6 pieces of **chorizo**
* 1 **cabbage**
* One or two beef/ham bones (for flavour)
* Breadcrumbs, garlic, eggs and parsley for the **"rellenos"**
* A piece of **lard**
* 300 gr of **small noodles** (pasta type)

## Preparation

1. Take the chickpeas, the beef, chorizo, bones and lard and put it in a casserole. Fill it with water until all ingredients are covered. Put it on medium heat and when it starts boiling decrease to low heat. Leave it for approximately 3 hours.
2. Separately, boil the cabbage until is ready. Take out the water. In the same casserole fry a garlic in olive oil and add some papprika. Be careful not to burn the papprika. Add the cabbage and mix.

3. For the "rellenos" beat a couple of eggs in a plate, add very small and thin pieces of garlic, add parsley, start adding breadcrumbs until it has the right consistency. If you don't know what the right consistency is, I am sorry, it is impossible to explain. Take a spoon and add the mix into a pan with very hot oil, make through all sides. Make as many as you wish.

4. After three hours take the morcilla and the rellenos and add to the casserole. Boil for another 10 minutes, then turn off the heat.
5. Put the chickpeas in one bowl and the meats in a different one. Put the cabbage also separately.
6. You will have a nice broth where you boiled the meat. Boil the pasta until it has the right consistency

## Serve

* First the broth with the pasta
* Then chickpeas
* Finally the meats and cabbage
  
Eat this with friends and/or family preferibly with a good red wine
