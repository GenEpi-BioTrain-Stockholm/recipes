A recipe repository for the GenEpi-BioTrain workshop, initially designed and developed at Clinical Genomics, Stockholm.

## Submit a recipe

Looking to submit a recipe? Follow these instructions:

### Open a pull request with the recipe you wish to add

The content of your recipe should be included in the docs folder of this repository. Make sure your recipe is created in the right category (appetizers, main_courses, desserts, drinks ..?). The text should be formatted in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

To create a pull request you could either:
- Create a new branch containing the changes on your computer and then push it to this repository to open the pull request
- Use the GitHub web-based editor to add changes and open a pull request

A simple guide on how to open a general pull request in GitHub can be found [here](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github). Keep in mind that this is the usual way to work with pull requests, but it requires basic usage of the terminal.

A guide on how to create a pull request using the GitHub web editor is present [here](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/the-githubdev-web-based-editor)
